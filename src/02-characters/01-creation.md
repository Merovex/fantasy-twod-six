## Character Creation

 Starting your character's story is the first big step you take before diving into a world full of adventure. First, you pick special traits that show who your character is and what they're good at. Then, you can choose where they come from, which gives them special skills and a cool backstory.

You get to build your character's story by choosing what they've been through, from learning their first skills to deciding to become an adventurer. As your character grows, they learn new things and get cool rewards. But, be careful, because sometimes things can get tricky or tough. When they're ready, you'll pick out their gear and get started. This way, you're all set to make your character's own legend.

And the best part? You get to decide all of this! You're not just leaving it all to luck; you're the one making the choices to create the perfect hero for your adventure

### Design Points

In Toady-Six, every player starts with design points based on the feel of the game. If it's average, they get seven. It's heroic or cinematic, they get more. With these points, you can build your character by increasing Traits and using them to buy Life Tours.

| Feel of Game | Design Points   |
| ------------ | --------------- |
| Average      | 7 Design Points |
| Heroic       | 8 Design Points |
| Cinematic    | 9 Design Points |

### Traits

Characters have six traits: Strength Agility, Vigor, Insight, Wit and Charisma.  Each Trait Level has a name, a score and an action modifier. They all start out at "Good," and you can spend design points to increase the Trait level. If you want more design points, you can reduce a Trait by one for each extra design point.

### Life Paths and Tours

Each hero embarks on a life journey even before the actual story begins. A Life Path is a direction your character follows, whether it be the rough and tumble life of a warrior or contemplative and reclusive life of a priest. A Life Tour is a chapter in your character's life where they learn new skills, face challenges and grow. Think of each one as a mini-adventure that shaped their skills and experiences. It's up to you to decide what experiences they've had, shaping their skills and story.

**Life Path.** There are several life paths described in the Life Paths appendix. One design point starts a Life Path and completes the first tour. With that comes all the Basic Skills of that path. Changing paths costs two design points, completes a tour on that path, and provides one skill from the new life path's Basic Skills. When you start a life path, your player is Rank-0 in that path. (E.g. Fighter-0)

**Aging and Life Tours.** With each Life Tour, your character ages, gaining wisdom and maybe a few gray hairs! This means they've lived through more adventures and have more stories to tell. But, remember, getting older also means they might not be as quick or strong as they once were, so you have to consider how many Life Tours you choose. When you're done, multiply the life tour length by the number of tours completed. Add that to the Apprenticeship start age and you have your character's starting age.

* Reduce STR, AGL or VIT by 1 for each life tour over four.
* You cannot complete more than seven tours.

**Advancement.** During a Life Tour, you can spend a point to advance the player's Rank. 

**Skills from Life Tours.** During each Life Tour, your character learns new things. Select a skill from the skill list. We've provided a way for you to roll dice to help you decide for when you can't decide.

**Benefits.** For each completed tour, the character gets a benefit associated with the life path where the tour benefit came from.

### Relationships

Characters did not live in a vacuum. Describe how you've crossed paths with two other characters during your life path(s).

### Getting ready for adventure

When the adventurer has finished their life path(s), they can purchase starting equipment.
