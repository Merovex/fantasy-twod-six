## Dwarf

Dwarven life paths are deeply rooted in their clans and the mountainous homes they come from. Dwarves may have been miners, smiths, warriors, or stonemasons, contributing to the wealth and defense of their strongholds. Their journey is one of tradition, craftsmanship, and a deep connection to the earth.
