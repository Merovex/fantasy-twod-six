## Life paths

In Toady Six, characters are not wet-behind-the-ears types. They are rugged adventurers who have followed their own life paths to get to where they are at the beginning of game play. Through life paths, players guide their characters through various professions, each marking a distinct phase in their lives, imbuing them with a rich backstory, skills, and sometimes the scars of past endeavors.

### Skills and Training

In the life path model tailored to the various paths outlined earlier— Fighter, Mage, Cleric, Rogue, Dwarf, Elf, and Halfling—each path comes with its own set of skill categories: Personal Growth, Core Skills, Path Specializations, and Learned Knowledge. As your character progresses through a life path, for each term of service, you select one of these categories and roll a 1d6 to identify the skill you enhance. Access to Learned Knowledge is contingent upon meeting specific prerequisites, typically a Wisdom score of 8+ or attaining a certain rank within the life path. Path Specializations are available if your life path offers them and you've achieved a requisite status or commission.

When a skill is gained or improved, it may be specified at a certain proficiency level. If the skill is listed without a level and you don't already possess it, you gain that skill at proficiency level 1. If you already have the skill, its proficiency level increases by one with a maximum level of four. Should the skill be noted with a particular proficiency level, you achieve it at that stated level, assuming it exceeds your current proficiency in that skill.

### Life Phase, Aging, Progress and Duration

Each life path comprises many phases. A particular phase of their life path emphasizes growth, learning, and the accumulation of experience. The typical phase of Human and Halfling life is four years; five and ten years for Dwarf and Elf, respectively.

**Duration.** When the duration role fails, that life phase doubles (8, 10 or 20 years), advancing the age of the character more than expected. This extended period represents not just the passage of time but the depth of engagement with their chosen path, allowing characters to fully immerse themselves in their roles, develop their skills, and grow both personally and professionally.

**Advancement.** Need words here.

**Progression.** The player rolls against the progression value when they want their character to enter another phase of learning and maturation.
