## Mage

Mages follow a path of arcane discovery and scholarly pursuit. Often starting their journey as apprentices to more experienced spellcasters, they spend years studying ancient tomes, practicing spells, and unlocking the secrets of the universe. Their life path is one of intellectual challenge, magical experimentation, and the occasional brush with otherworldly entities.
