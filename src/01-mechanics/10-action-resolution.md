## Action Resolution

Toady-Six uses action resolution to find out whether a character succeeds in an attempted action, but we want to keep dice roles to a minimum. A Referee should require an Action Test (skill- or trait-based) only to heighten drama and tension. Do not roll if the action is so easy as to be automatic, or too difficult to succeed.

- **Unopposed Action.** When an action is unopposed, then the Threshold number is 8.
- **Opposed Action.** When a target opposes the action (e.g. persuasion), then the Threshold is the greater of the Target's attribute or 8. (e.g. persuasion target's Wisdom is 10, so the Threshold is 10. ) Difficulty is still applicable.

The core action test is `Success Degree = Threshold Number - (2d6 + Action Modifiers)`. Roll the dice and apply the modifiers. Subtract that result from eight to determine the success degree using the Action Modifier table below.
