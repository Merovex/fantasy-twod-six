## Damage

Toady-Six uses Trait-based damage mechanic. Damage applies to an appropriate adventurer trait.

**Physical Damage.** When someone takes physical damage, take the damage away from their Vigor until it drops to zero. After that, the person can choose to lose points from either their Strength or Agility next. If two of these physical abilities — Vigor, Strength, or Agility — drop to zero, the person passes out. And if all three physical traits are at zero, then the person dies.

**Fatigue.** Similar to physical damage, strenuous effort affects the person's Vigor. Once Virgor drops to zero, additional fatigue affects either Strength or Agility, depending on the person's choice. When both traits are zero, the person must rest.

**Sanity/Mental Damage.** Traumatizing situations can affect a person's sanity is affected. Mental damage affects either the person's Will or Wisdom, depending on the person's choice. When that reaches zero, then the other trait is affected. When both are reduced to zero, they become incoherent until they get serious help.

**Social Damage.** In games where this matters, social conflicts can adversely affect reputation and influence. When this happens, Charisma reduces based on t until zero.
