# Arcane Powers and Divine Gifts

[TOC]

In the tapestry of the cosmos, two fundamental forces weave the fabric of reality: Arcane Power and Divine Gifts. Arcane Power, drawn from the wellspring of the universe's hidden energies, is mastered through rigorous study, intuition, and the strength of oneâ€™s will. It is the realm of mages and sorcerers, those who seek to understand the underlying mechanisms of magic itself. These practitioners manipulate the weave of magical forces to cast spells, create enchantments, and even alter the fabric of reality through sheer force of knowledge and discipline. Arcane Power is a testament to pursuing understanding, a path lined with ancient tomes, mystical runes, and the unquenchable thirst for knowledge.

Parallel to the mysteries of Arcane Power are the Divine Gifts, bestowed upon the devout and the faithful. These are powers granted by deities, spirits, or cosmic entities, transcending the mere manipulation of magical energies. Priests, clerics, and paladins walk this path, serving as conduits for the will of their patrons, channeling divine energy to heal, protect, and smite. Unlike the Arcane, which is claimed by those who dare to unlock its secrets, Divine Gifts are given, chosen by forces beyond mortal comprehension, requiring not only faith but a deep, personal connection to the divine. Together, Arcane Power and Divine Gifts shape the world, one a testament to human ambition and intellect, the other a reflection of grace and the bonds between the mortal and the divine.

## Mana Power/Gift

"Mana" stands as the universal force that permeates every aspect of the cosmos, binding the fabric of reality with threads of arcane energy. This exists both for mages and priests as power or gift, respectively. The trait "Mana Power" or "Mana Gift" quantifies a character's inherent ability to tap into, manipulate, and harness this fundamental energy. For mages, Mana Power represents their skill and efficiency in drawing upon arcane forces to cast spells, create magical artifacts, and perform feats beyond the bounds of the natural world. For priests, Mana Gift signifies the depth of their divine connection, enabling them to channel Mana into miracles and blessings given by their deities. Mana Power is not merely a measure of one's magical potential; it reflects their bond with the very essence of creation, determining the magnitude and impact of their actions within the tapestry of magic.

Determine the adventurer's power/gift using the formula: `2d6 - Life Phases + Mage Rank + Priest Rank`.

## Spell Casting

Spell casters must perform an Action Test using the relevant spell (below). They add to this their Mana trait along with any additional action modifiers. A successful casting costs the spell's Mana points. A failure costs one point. Should this expenditure reduce their Mana to below zero, apply the deficit from their Vigor score as fatigue damage. A character devoid of Mana points is incapable of casting spells.

* Success Cost: Spell Mana Cost based on Potency
* Failure Cost: 1 Mana
* Mana reduced below Zero: Reduce Vigor as damage
* Casting a spell during combat is a significant action.

## Spell Types

Toady Six RPG bases magic on a Four-by-Five model. There are four actions Four Actions (Communicate/Sense, Control, Diminish and Enhance) with Five Realms (Body, Mind, Spirit, Energy, Matter), resulting in twenty unique spell categories. The system allows for adjustments that fit various campaign settings, from magic-rich to magic-scarce environments. Spell-casting is not without drawbacks, which adds depth and realism to their use. Each action and realm combination provides a framework for creating spells that interact with the game world in specific, nuanced ways.

Encourage player creativity in describing their character's spells, but they should reference the Potency/Action/Realm (e.g. Superb Control Energy) to readily reference their creation to the mechanic.

### Actions

- **Communicate/Sense:** Enables understanding, sensing, or communicating with others or the environment (e.g., telepathy, sensing magic).
- **Control:** Exerts dominion over a target, shaping or commanding its actions or form (e.g., telekinesis, mind control).

- **Diminish:** Reduces or weakens a specific attribute, ability, or condition (e.g., causing injury, reducing size).
- **Enhance:** Increases or improves a specific attribute, ability, or condition (e.g., healing, strengthening).

### Realms

- **Body:** Pertains to the physical form of living entities, including humans, animals, and plants (e.g., healing wounds, enhancing physical strength).
- **Mind:** Involves the psychological aspects of beings (e.g., boosting memory, inducing confusion).
- **Spirit:** Focuses on ethereal and non-corporeal entities, such as ghosts or spirits (e.g., summoning spirits, banishing undead).
- **Energy:** Encompasses all forms of energy, including elemental forces and magical energy (e.g., manipulating fire, controlling air currents).
- **Matter:** Deals with inanimate objects and materials (e.g., shaping metal, strengthening stone).

### Potency 

Potency categorizes spells in four levels from Fair to Superb, affecting both the difficulty of casting and the mana cost. Spell-casting is not without drawbacks. Casting spells can lead to the caster suffering fatigue. This adds strategic depth to the use of magic, encouraging players to weigh the benefits of casting more powerful spells against the potential risks and consequences. It enriches the role-playing experience, as players must consider their character's physical and mental state when planning to use magic and deal with the aftermath of their actions, regardless of whether they are successful.

**Fair.** These spells are relatively easy to cast and have minor effects that observers might not immediate recognized as magical. They are practical for everyday problems and require the least amount of mana. Since these spells are relatively minor, casting them might cause mild fatigue, recoverable with a brief rest. Severe failure at this level could lead to temporary discomfort or disorientation, but it is unlikely to have long-lasting effects.

**Good.** Spells of Good potency are more noticeable and can affect significant changes or challenges. They still operate within the bounds of believability, but show clear magical influence. Casting spells of Good potency requires more concentration and energy, leading to moderate fatigue. Characters might need longer rest to recover fully. Severe failure could cause significant distress, such as headaches, nausea, or heightened anxiety, potentially affecting the caster's abilities for a short period.

**Great.** These spells produce effects that are unmistakably magical and go beyond the natural capabilities of individuals or objects. They are more challenging to cast and require a good understanding of magical principles. The effort to cast Great potency spells could cause substantial fatigue, making the caster need substantial rest or specific conditions to recover their full magical capabilities. Severe failure at this level might not only cause intense physical or mental distress, but could also lead to temporary loss of specific magical abilities or a decrease in overall effectiveness in casting any spells for a certain duration.

**Superb.** Superb spells are among the most powerful and have dramatic, often instantaneous, effects that can significantly alter situations or beings. These spells are difficult to cast, reflecting their potent impact on the world. Given their power, casting Superb potency spells could be highly fatiguing, possibly requiring days of rest or special magical rejuvenation to overcome the exhaustion. Severe failure when attempting such powerful magic could cause critical distress, manifesting as long-term physical or psychological harm. It could also lead to a permanent loss of magical talents or a significant, enduring weakness to certain types of magic.
